## Description

**Modular Adversarial Robustness Toolkit** makes it easy to compose novel attacks to evaluate adversarial robustness of deep learning models. Thanks to the modular design of the optimization-based attack framework, you can use off-the-shelf elements, such as optimizers and learning rate schedulers, from PyTorch to compose powerful attacks. The unified framework also supports advanced features, such as early stopping, to improve attack efficiency.

## Installation

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/IntelLabs/MART
cd MART

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n myenv python=3.9
conda activate myenv

# [OPTIONAL] or create virtualenv environment
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# [OPTIONAL] install pre-commit hooks
# this will trigger the pre-commit checks in each `git commit` command.
pre-commit install


# Install Modular Adversarial Robustness Toolkit, if you plan to create your own `configs` folder elsewhere.
pip install -e .

# If your CUDA version is not 10.2, you need to uninstall pytorch and torchvision, and
# then reinstall them according to platform instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/
# FYI, this is what we do:
#   $ pip uninstall torch torchvision
#   $ pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116

```

## How to run

The [configs](/configs) folder is required to run the toolkit. You can evaluate adversarial robustness of pretrained models with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/). Feel free to override any parameter from command line. Run `make` to learn more tasks pre-defined in [Makefile](Makefile).

```bash
# run on CPU
python -m mart experiment=CIFAR10_RobustBench \
	trainer=default \
	fit=false \
	+trainer.limit_test_batches=1 \
	+attack@model.modules.input_adv_test=classification_eps8_pgd10_step1

# run on GPU
python -m mart experiment=CIFAR10_RobustBench \
	trainer=gpu \
	fit=false \
	+trainer.limit_test_batches=1 \
	+attack@model.modules.input_adv_test=classification_eps8_pgd10_step1

# train on 1 GPU
python -m mart experiment=ArmoryCarlaOverObjDet_TorchvisionFasterRCNN \
	task_name=1GPU_ArmoryCarlaOverObjDet_TorchvisionFasterRCNN \
	trainer=gpu \
	fit=true

# train on multiple GPUs using Distributed Data Parallel
python -m mart experiment=ArmoryCarlaOverObjDet_TorchvisionFasterRCNN \
	task_name=2GPUs_ArmoryCarlaOverObjDet_TorchvisionFasterRCNN \
	fit=true \
	trainer=ddp \
	trainer.devices=2 \
	datamodule.ims_per_batch=4 \
	model.optimizer.lr=0.025 \
	trainer.max_steps=5244
```

You can also install the repository as a package, then run `python -m mart` from anywhere with your own `configs` folder.
