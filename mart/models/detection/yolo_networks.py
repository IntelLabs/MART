    """The YOLOv5 network architecture. Different variants (n/s/m/l/x) can be achieved by adjusting the ``depth``
    and ``width`` parameters.

    Args:
        num_classes: Number of different classes that this model predicts.
        backbone: A backbone network that returns the output from each stage.
        width: Number of channels in the narrowest convolutional layer. The wider convolutional layers will use a number
            of channels that is a multiple of this value. The values used by the different variants are 16 (yolov5n), 32
            (yolov5s), 48 (yolov5m), 64 (yolov5l), and 80 (yolov5x).
        depth: Repeat the bottleneck layers this many times. Can be used to make the network deeper. The values used by
            the different variants are 1 (yolov5n, yolov5s), 2 (yolov5m), 3 (yolov5l), and 4 (yolov5x).
        activation: Which layer activation to use. Can be "relu", "leaky", "mish", "silu" (or "swish"), "logistic",
            "linear", or "none".
        normalization: Which layer normalization to use. Can be "batchnorm", "groupnorm", or "none".
        prior_shapes: A list of prior box dimensions, used for scaling the predicted dimensions and possibly for
            matching the targets to the anchors. The list should contain [width, height] pairs in the network input
            resolution. There should be `3N` pairs, where `N` is the number of anchors per spatial location. They are
            assigned to the layers from the lowest (high-resolution) to the highest (low-resolution) layer, meaning that
            you typically want to sort the shapes from the smallest to the largest.
        matching_algorithm: Which algorithm to use for matching targets to anchors. "simota" (the SimOTA matching rule
            from YOLOX), "size" (match those prior shapes, whose width and height relative to the target is below given
            ratio), "iou" (match all prior shapes that give a high enough IoU), or "maxiou" (match the prior shape that
            gives the highest IoU, default).
        matching_threshold: Threshold for "size" and "iou" matching algorithms.
        spatial_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors that are within an `N x N` grid cell
            area centered at the target, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        size_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors whose dimensions are no more than `N` and
            no less than `1/N` times the target dimensions, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        ignore_bg_threshold: If a predictor is not responsible for predicting any target, but the prior shape has IoU
            with some target greater than this threshold, the predictor will not be taken into account when calculating
            the confidence loss.
        overlap_func: Which function to use for calculating the IoU between two sets of boxes. Valid values are "iou",
            "giou", "diou", and "ciou".
        predict_overlap: Balance between binary confidence targets and predicting the overlap. 0.0 means that the target
            confidence is 1 if there's an object, and 1.0 means that the target confidence is the output of
            ``overlap_func``.
        label_smoothing: The epsilon parameter (weight) for class label smoothing. 0.0 means no smoothing (binary
            targets), and 1.0 means that the target probabilities are always 0.5.
        overlap_loss_multiplier: Overlap loss will be scaled by this value.
        confidence_loss_multiplier: Confidence loss will be scaled by this value.
        class_loss_multiplier: Classification loss will be scaled by this value.
        xy_scale: Eliminate "grid sensitivity" by scaling the box coordinates by this factor. Using a value > 1.0 helps
            to produce coordinate values close to one.

    """The YOLOX network architecture. Different variants (nano/tiny/s/m/l/x) can be achieved by adjusting the
    ``depth`` and ``width`` parameters.

    Args:
        num_classes: Number of different classes that this model predicts.
        backbone: A backbone network that returns the output from each stage.
        width: Number of channels in the narrowest convolutional layer. The wider convolutional layers will use a number
            of channels that is a multiple of this value. The values used by the different variants are 24 (yolox-tiny),
            32 (yolox-s), 48 (yolox-m), and 64 (yolox-l).
        depth: Repeat the bottleneck layers this many times. Can be used to make the network deeper. The values used by
            the different variants are 1 (yolox-tiny, yolox-s), 2 (yolox-m), and 3 (yolox-l).
        activation: Which layer activation to use. Can be "relu", "leaky", "mish", "silu" (or "swish"), "logistic",
            "linear", or "none".
        normalization: Which layer normalization to use. Can be "batchnorm", "groupnorm", or "none".
        prior_shapes: A list of prior box dimensions, used for scaling the predicted dimensions and possibly for
            matching the targets to the anchors. The list should contain [width, height] pairs in the network input
            resolution. There should be `3N` pairs, where `N` is the number of anchors per spatial location. They are
            assigned to the layers from the lowest (high-resolution) to the highest (low-resolution) layer, meaning that
            you typically want to sort the shapes from the smallest to the largest.
        matching_algorithm: Which algorithm to use for matching targets to anchors. "simota" (the SimOTA matching rule
            from YOLOX), "size" (match those prior shapes, whose width and height relative to the target is below given
            ratio), "iou" (match all prior shapes that give a high enough IoU), or "maxiou" (match the prior shape that
            gives the highest IoU, default).
        matching_threshold: Threshold for "size" and "iou" matching algorithms.
        spatial_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors that are within an `N x N` grid cell
            area centered at the target, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        size_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors whose dimensions are no more than `N` and
            no less than `1/N` times the target dimensions, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        ignore_bg_threshold: If a predictor is not responsible for predicting any target, but the prior shape has IoU
            with some target greater than this threshold, the predictor will not be taken into account when calculating
            the confidence loss.
        overlap_func: Which function to use for calculating the IoU between two sets of boxes. Valid values are "iou",
            "giou", "diou", and "ciou".
        predict_overlap: Balance between binary confidence targets and predicting the overlap. 0.0 means that the target
            confidence is 1 if there's an object, and 1.0 means that the target confidence is the output of
            ``overlap_func``.
        label_smoothing: The epsilon parameter (weight) for class label smoothing. 0.0 means no smoothing (binary
            targets), and 1.0 means that the target probabilities are always 0.5.
        overlap_loss_multiplier: Overlap loss will be scaled by this value.
        confidence_loss_multiplier: Confidence loss will be scaled by this value.
        class_loss_multiplier: Classification loss will be scaled by this value.
        xy_scale: Eliminate "grid sensitivity" by scaling the box coordinates by this factor. Using a value > 1.0 helps
            to produce coordinate values close to one.

            ratio), "iou" (match all prior shapes that give a high enough IoU), or "maxiou" (match the prior shape that
            gives the highest IoU, default).
        matching_threshold: Threshold for "size" and "iou" matching algorithms.
        spatial_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors that are within an `N x N` grid cell
            area centered at the target, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        size_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors whose dimensions are no more than `N` and
            no less than `1/N` times the target dimensions, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        ignore_bg_threshold: If a predictor is not responsible for predicting any target, but the corresponding anchor
            has IoU with some target greater than this threshold, the predictor will not be taken into account when
            calculating the confidence loss.
        overlap_func: Which function to use for calculating the IoU between two sets of boxes. Valid values are "iou",
            "giou", "diou", and "ciou".
        predict_overlap: Balance between binary confidence targets and predicting the overlap. 0.0 means that the target
            confidence is 1 if there's an object, and 1.0 means that the target confidence is the output of
            ``overlap_func``.
        label_smoothing: The epsilon parameter (weight) for class label smoothing. 0.0 means no smoothing (binary
            targets), and 1.0 means that the target probabilities are always 0.5.
        overlap_loss_multiplier: Overlap loss will be scaled by this value.
        confidence_loss_multiplier: Confidence loss will be scaled by this value.
        class_loss_multiplier: Classification loss will be scaled by this value.
